# Processing unusual file types

Certain file types require atypical processing workflows, often using specialized software. This guide documents CCA's workflows for processing unusual file types and their related software, which include:  

* [Email archives and ePADD](#email)
    * [Email formats](#emailformats)
    * [Import and appraisal module](#emailappraisal)
    * [Processing module](#emailprocessing)
    * [Export, SIPs, AIPs, and DIPs](#emailexport)
    * [Delivery module](#emaildelivery)

## Email archives and ePADD

Email formats require additional processing, as they often contain sensitive or personal information, and as a format, are difficult to access by an end-user. [ePADD](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd), developed by Stanford University Libraries, allows the processing archivist to search through email, restrict possibly sensitive materials, and provide a user-friendly access interface.

Full documentation on ePADD can be found in their [User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZMuWU0z-IVsk80_lUEYMfVrwfCsS1bp0sjL28GBGcMU/edit) and the [Community Forum](https://epadd.nimeyo.com/). 

ePADD can be downloaded [here](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd/download), and installation instructions can be found in the User Guide. CCA recommends installing ePADD into Mac or Windows environments.

### Email formats 

ePADD only works with live email accounts (including IMAP) and email archives in the MBOX format. If your email archives are in a different email format, like Microsoft Outlook PST, they will need to be converted using [Emailchemy](https://weirdkid.com/emailchemy/), an email format converter located on the CD imaging workstation. The readpst command line utility is not recommended. 

Confirm the following settings are selected in Emailchemy:
