# Capturing Web Archives using Archive-It

Web archiving is the practice of using capture tools to crawl websites and save their contents. These result in web archiving (WARC) files, a container file that packages all of the code, media, and other elements of a website. WARC files are the preservation format for websites and can be played back to display the website as it appeared on the live web at the time of capture. 

CCA uses the web app [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/) to capture certain types of web content related to our collecting interests. The web collections can be accessed through the [CCA microsite](https://archive-it.org/home/Canadian-Centre-for-Architecture). Metadata is controlled locally, and playback is mediated through the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). 

Archive-It has a [Help Center](https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us), [User Guide](https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/categories/201179946-Archive-It-User-Guide), and [Community Forum](https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/community/topics), which should serve as primary documentation and a resource for troubleshooting.
