# Description of born-digital archives  

Once the arrangement of the accession(s) being processed has been finalized, it is time to think in greater detail about the second half of processing: description. This guide describes CCA's standards for description of born-digital records in The Museum System (TMS), and includes:

* [Principles and practical guidelines for description of born-digital archives](#descriptionprincipleandpractice)  
* [Fonds-, series-, and project-level description](#higherlevel)
* [File ("groupe")-level description](#groupdesc)
    * [Entering file-level description in processing spreadsheets](#spreadsheetentry)  
    * [Entering file-level description in TMS](#tmsentry)  
       * [Required elements of description](#grouprequiredelements)

## Principles and practical guidelines for description of born-digital archives  

* "Choose to guide, not to map": Let the researcher do their own research, but give them a good enough sense of the content and context of records to know where to focus their energies.  
* "Let the bits describe themselves": Machine-actionable information such as extent, file formats, and filesystem metadata should be captured automatically, never calculated by hand, and rarely transcribed.  
* Born-digital records may not reflect traditional Stage and Purpose architectural terminology/practice - don't force terminology where it doesn't fit.  
* Description will be entered and updated in processing spreadsheets that can later be imported into AtoM. Entering this data in TMS will require some fields to be manually entered, but you should copy and paste from your processing spreadsheet when possible. Make sure that any revisions to your description are completed prior to entering data into TMS.  
* Preferred terminology

## Fonds-, series-, and project-level description  

Your higher level (fonds-, series-, and project-level) descriptions should follow the guidelines set out for these levels of description in the overall CCA Archives Processing Manual.  

Lines about digital materials in Collation statements in fonds-, series-, and dossier-level records should take the following form: "x digital files (y KB/MB/GB)", e.g. "1,760 digital files (50.3 GB)".  

<a name="groupdesc"></a>  
## File ("groupe")-level description  

File ("groupe")-level description is the lowest level of description done during typical processing projects, and should follow the guidelines set out in the overall CCA Archives Processing Manual. Description will happen first in spreadsheets. Do not enter any file-level information into TMS until that spreadsheet has gone through the review and approval process with the Digital Archivist.  

Note that all directories of digital content should be described as files/groupes, even if they only contain one digital file. We are planning to have the item-level records containing technical information for the file generated by Archivematica/AtoM, not manually by an archivist or cataloguer. The group-level record should aim to: (1) guide researchers to potentially useful information and (2) characterize and provide contextual information to supplement the technical metadata extracted by Archivematica.

### Entering file-level description in processing spreadsheets  

File-level description should be entered and reviewed in spreadsheets (one spreadsheet per series or project, depending on volume). These spreadsheets will be used to import description directly into AtoM once descriptions have been finalized.  

| Column | ISAD element | Value |
| ------ | ------------ | ----- |
| Accession Number | n/a | Versement number |
| Parent ID | n/a | Identifier of parent (e.g. series) |
| Identifier | ISAD 3.1.1 | Identifier of file (groupe) |
| Title | ISAD 3.1.2 | Supplied or original title, according to standard Titling Procedures. Do not use a file or directory name as a title. |

### Entering file-level description in TMS  

Once your processing spreadsheet is finalized, use the following instructions to enter the information into TMS, copying and pasting from the spreadsheet when possible. This can be done most efficiently by making use of Models that pre-populate new records with consistent information such as nom de l'objet, status flags, and credit line.  

**Please do not enter data into any TMS fields that are not listed in the Required or Optional sections below.**  

<a name="grouprequiredelements"></a>  
#### Required elements of description  

##### Internal management information  

| TMS field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| Department/Département| "Archives" |
| Virtual Object/Objet virtuel | No (unchecked) |  
| Status flags/Indicateurs du status de l'objet | "inventaire" and "Y processed" (note: Y flags to be replaced by flex field) |
| Credit line/Ligne de credit | Enter as usual |  
| Alternate number | Enter fonds number (AP###) as an alternate number for all records within an archive. |  
| Archive constituent | Add an "Archive" constituent to every record within an archive. |  
| Object count/Nombre de l'objet | "1" |  
| Object name/Nom de l'objet | "file" |  
| "Object type" attribute | digital/numérique |  

##### Elements of archival description  

| Element of description | TMS field | Value |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Identifier (ISAD 3.1.1) | Object number/Numéro de l'objet | Archival number composed of the fonds, series, subseries, dossier, and group numbers, as applicable (e.g. "AP500.S1.1996.D1.001" or "AP174.S2.001") |
| Level of description (ISAD 3.1.4) | Classification | "groupe" |
| Title (ISAD 3.1.2) | Title/Titre | Supplied or original title, according to standard Titling Procedures. Do not use a file or directory name as a title. |
| Dates (ISAD 3.1.3) | Dates | Inclusive dates of creation for the material being described. Your best sources of information about dates are likely to be the last modified dates of files (not folders) and the contents of the records themselves. Enter the date value in the "Date" field within "Désignation date" and hit Tab to auto-populate "Date de début" and "Date de fin". Use "ca. " and make an educated guess where there is a doubt as to the exact year(s) of creation. When you are really unsure as to the date, it is always better to give a wide range (e.g. "ca. 1970-2000") than no date at all. Do not enter "Date d'effet" or "Dates historiques". | 
| Extent and medium (ISAD 3.1.5) | "Collation" text entry | Enter a full extent statement, using the following form: "x files, y folders (z KB/MB/GB/TB)", e.g. "350 files, 15 folders (2.3 GB)". If there are no folders, simply omit this information from the line, e.g. "350 files (18 MB)". |

#### Optional elements of description  

##### Optional elements that may be used somewhat frequently   

| Element of description | TMS field | Value |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Scope and content note (ISAD 3.3.1) | Content description/Description du contenu | Include a scope and content note if the title needs to be supplemented to be properly understood, if content falls outside the scope of higher-level (e.g. series and project) descriptions, or to call attention to records of note. Because born-digital records are typically described in large aggregate groupes, the scope and content note may be the best place to give researchers a clear sense of what they can expect to find within any particular file. Your scope and content note should follow the archives-wide guidelines for Writing Scope and Content Notes. For groups of born-digital records, your scope and content note can also include: **Original directory and file names:** Use the form "Original directory name: [NAME]". or "Original file name: [NAME]". **Prevalent file types:** Give a short listing of prevalent file-types. For any original directories, this information will be available to you in the reports supplied by the Digital Archivist. Use the form "Prevalent file types: .extension, .extension, .extension" using all lower-case letters for file extensions. |  
| System of arrangement (ISAD 3.3.4) | "1.8B13-classement" text entry | Specify the internal structure, order and/or the system of classification of the unit of description. Note how these have been treated by the archivist. For electronic records, record or reference information on system design. (ISAD 3.3.4) |  

##### Optional elements that should be used rarely  
Please discuss with Digital Archivist or Archivist before regularly including the following fields in your group-level descriptions.  

| Element of description | TMS field | Value |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Constituents (ISAD?) | Personne(s) et institution(s) | For groups, add constituents only in rare cases, and only then when the person you wish to call attention to has not already been added as a constituent in a higher level of description (e.g. in project, series, or fonds-level records). |
| Language of material being described (ISAD 3.4.3) | "1.8B14-langue" text entry | Note the language(s) of the material in the file or item if this differs from the note given at the series or fonds level; e.g. "Records in this file are in Spanish." |
| Finding aids (ISAD 3.4.5) | "1.8B17-instruments de recherche" text entry | Use this field to record the availability of finding aids, inventories, and other discoverability tools external to TMS. |
| Related units of description (ISAD 3.5.3) | "1.8B20-docs reliés fonds different" text entry | Use this field to record related records in other fonds as well as other CCA resources including (but not limited to) recordings of lectures, library holdings, photography collections, and prints and drawings. |
| Conditions governing access (ISAD 3.4.1) | "1.8B16a-restrictions à la consultation" text entry | Enter detailed information about restrictions on access here. NOTE: If the material has restrictions, you should also ensure that the record includes a Restriction status flag. |
| Conditions governing reproduction (ISAD 3.4.2) | "1.8B16c-restric. à l'utilis. et repro." text entry | Input information about limitations on use and reproduction such as copyright only if it is already known (i.e. do not conduct research solely for the purposes of adding this note) and if it is not already captured at a higher level of description. |
| General note (ISAD 3.6.1) | "1.8B21-générale" text entry | Enter any notes not belonging to the above required or optional fields that are intended for public display. |
| General note - non-public | "**Note générale non-destinée au public" text entry | Enter any notes not belonging to the above required or optional fields that are not suitable for public display. |  

#### Unresolved questions  

* Subjects  
* Form/digital object types (as tag?)  
* How to resolve creator vs. name access points  
* Add something about linking to versement in TMS

## Item ("pièce")-level description  

Item-level cataloguing for digital files is rare and should only be done when discussed in pre-processing. All "pièce" records must exist as a child of a groupe.
