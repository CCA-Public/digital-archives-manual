# Description of born-digital archives  

Once the processing plan is set and the overall arrangement of the accession(s) being processed has been finalized, it is time to think in greater detail about the second half of processing: description. This guide describes CCA's standards for description of born-digital records in spreadsheets (eventually to be imported into AtoM) and The Museum System (TMS), and includes:

* [Principles and practical guidelines for description of born-digital archives](#descriptionprincipleandpractice)  
* [Fonds-, series-, and project-level description](#higherlevel)
* [File ("groupe")-level description](#groupdesc)
    * [Entering file-level description in processing spreadsheets](#spreadsheetentry)  
    * [Entering file-level description in TMS](#tmsentry)  
       * [Internal management information](#internalmanagement)  
       * [Elements of archival description](#archivalelements)  
* [Item ("pièce")-level description](#itemdesc)

## Principles and practical guidelines for description of born-digital archives  

* "Choose to guide, not to map": Let the researcher do their own research, but give them a good enough sense of the content and context of records to know where to focus their energies.  
* "Let the bits describe themselves": Machine-actionable information such as extent, file formats, and filesystem metadata should be captured automatically, never calculated by hand, and rarely transcribed.  
* Born-digital records may not reflect traditional Stage and Purpose architectural terminology/practice - don't force terminology where it doesn't fit.  
* Description will be entered and updated in processing spreadsheets (that will eventually enable easier import into AtoM). Entering this data in TMS will require some fields to be manually entered, but you should copy and paste from your processing spreadsheet when possible. Make sure that any revisions to your description are completed prior to entering data into TMS.  

<a name="higherlevel"></a>  
## Fonds-, series-, and project-level description  

Your higher level (fonds-, series-, and project-level) descriptions should follow the guidelines set out for these levels of description in the overall CCA Archives Processing Manual.  

Fonds, series, and project records must be entered directly into TMS, but should be written and reviewed in the Finding Aid Template Word document and/or a spreadsheet (for projects) first. If we are able to move to AtoM, fonds and series records will be entered directly in AtoM. Projects will also be entered manual or can be imported using the standard project description spreadsheet.  

Lines about digital materials in Collation statements in fonds-, series-, and dossier-level records should take the following form: "x digital files (y KB/MB/GB)", e.g. "1,760 digital files (50.3 GB)".  

<a name="groupdesc"></a>  
## File ("groupe")-level description  

File ("groupe")-level description is the lowest level of description done during typical processing projects, and should follow the guidelines set out in the overall CCA Archives Processing Manual. Description will happen first in spreadsheets. Do not enter any file-level information into TMS until that spreadsheet has gone through the review and approval process with the Digital Archivist.  

Note that all directories of digital content should be described as files/groupes, even if they only contain one digital file. We are planning to have the item-level records containing technical information for the file generated by Archivematica/AtoM, not manually by an archivist or cataloguer. The group-level record should aim to: (1) guide researchers to potentially useful information and (2) characterize and provide contextual information to supplement the technical metadata extracted by Archivematica.

### Entering file-level description in processing spreadsheets  

File-level description should be entered and reviewed in spreadsheets (one spreadsheet per series or project, depending on volume). These spreadsheets will be used to import description directly into AtoM once descriptions have been finalized.  

| Column | ISAD element | Required? | Value |
| :----: | :------------: | :---------: | :---- |
| Accession number | n/a | Yes | Versement number |
| Parent | n/a | Yes | Identifier of parent (e.g. series or project) |
| Identifier | 3.1.1 | Yes | Identifier of file (groupe). This should be an archival number composed of the fonds, series, subseries, dossier, and group numbers, as applicable (e.g. "AP500.S1.1996.PR1.001" or "AP174.S2.001") |
| Title | 3.1.2 | Yes | Supplied or original title, according to standard Titling Procedures. Do not use a file or directory name as a title. |
| Creators | 3.2.1 | No | Enter the fonds creator (in TMS, this will be a consituent with role "creator") |
| Date expression | 3.1.3 | Yes | Enter a free-text date expression, according to CCA's standard archival procedures for dates |
| Date start, Date end | 3.1.3 | Yes | Enter machine-readable beginning and end dates in ISO8601 format. Acceptable date formats: YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, YYYY. If the file has only a single date (e.g. 1990 or 1990-01-20), enter this in both Date start and Date end. |
| Level of description | 3.1.4 | Yes | "File" |
| Extent and medium | 3.1.5 | Yes | This information will be script-generated, in the form "x digital files, y folders (z bytes/KB/MB/GB/TB)" or "x digital files (y bytes/KB/MB/GB/TB)". Unless value is "EMPTY", do not modify except when discussed with Digital Archivist. |
| Scope and content | 3.3.1 | Yes | Add a Scope and Content note if title information needs to be supplemented, content falls outside scope of your higher level description, or to call attention to records of note. Because groupes of born-digital records are often voluminous and internally complex, detailed scope and content notes will be more common for this material than for other formats. For groups of born-digital records, the scope and content note field in your processing spreadsheet will be pre-populated with the following script-generated information. Verify and edit these lines as needed, and make sure they are at the end of your note: *"Original directory name: [NAME]". "Prevalent file types: .ext, .ext, .ext” (up to 5 extensions, sorted from most common to least)* |
| Arrangement | 3.3.4 | No | Not necessary at file level but can be used to indicate manual re-arrangement when it has been done for some files but not others within the same series. |
| Conditions governing access | 3.4.1 | No | Only enter at file-level when conditions governing access differ from general conditions set at higher level. |
| Conditions governing reproduction | 3.4.2 | No | Only enter at file-level when conditions governing reproduction differ from general conditions set at higher level. |
| Language | 3.4.3 | No | Do not enter at file level except under rare circumstances and when discussed with an Archivist. |
| Finding aids | 3.4.5 | No | Do not enter at file level except under rare circumstances and when discussed with an Archivist. |
| Related units of description | 3.5.3 | No | Do not enter at file level except under rare circumstances and when discussed with an Archivist. |
| Note | 3.6.1 | No | Do not enter at file level except under rare circumstances and when discussed with an Archivist. |
| Folder number | n/a | No | n/a |
| Box number | n/a | No | n/a |
| Subject access points | n/a | Yes | "born-digital" (and, optionally, another object type from the list in the File Descriptive Standards - e.g. for a directory of videos, you may enter both "born-digital" and "moving images". When you input multiple values, be sure they are separated with a pipe) |
| Name access points | n/a | No | Optionally, enter name access points (and roles) of people or corporate bodies associated with or resposible for the creation of the file. Do not enter at file level except under rare circumstances and when discussed with an Archivist. |  
| Description status | n/a | No | Leave blank |
| Level of detail | n/a | No | Leave blank |

### Entering file-level description in TMS  

Once your processing spreadsheet is finalized, use the following instructions to enter the information into TMS, copying and pasting from the spreadsheet when possible. This can be done most efficiently by making use of Models that pre-populate new records with consistent information such as nom de l'objet, status flags, and credit line.  

The only types of information you should enter into TMS that will not be found in your processing spreadsheet are  associations and the elements in [Internal management information](#internalmanagement) below.  

<a name="internalmanagement"></a>
#### Internal management information  

| TMS field | Value |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| Department/Département| "Archives" |
| Virtual Object/Objet virtuel | No (unchecked) |  
| Status flags/Indicateurs du status de l'objet | "traitement en cours" (to be batched changed to "inventaire" when finding aid is published) |
| Credit line/Ligne de credit | Enter as usual |  
| Alternate number | Enter fonds number (AP###) as an alternate number for all records within an archive. |  
| Archive constituent | Add an "Archive" constituent to every record within an archive. |  
| Object count/Nombre de l'objet | "1" |  
| Object name/Nom de l'objet | "file" |  
| "Object type" attribute | "born-digital"/"né numérique" (and, optionally, another object type) |

#### Unresolved questions  

* Subjects  
* Form/digital object types (as tag?)  
* How to resolve creator vs. name access points  
* Add something about linking to versement in TMS

## Item ("pièce")-level description  

Item-level cataloguing for digital files is rare and should only be done when discussed in pre-processing. All "pièce" records must exist as a child of a groupe.
